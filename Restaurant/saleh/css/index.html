      <div class="lead">
        <p>Having moved from the original site in Leigh, the Sawmill Brewery has been turning out beer from premises
          just out of Matakana since February 2016. The end of July 2016 we opened the doors to visitors and locals to
          experience the kind of hospitality Sawmill is about - straight forward and generous.</p>

      <p class="p">Our menu celebrates the farmers and growers we work with. Ingredients are ethically sourced, seasonal
        and&nbsp;availability is often weather dependent. Our cheeses, olive oil, kaimoana, beef, bread, olives, fruit
        and vegetables are largely sourced from the Mahurangi region. </p>
      <p class="p1">Our food is created to share amongst friends and family. Each dish is served as ready.</p>

    <h3 class="title-1">DAYTIME</h3>
    <p>For groups under 20pax we are a walk-in only venue between 12pm - 5.30pm. Just come on in at any time and we will
      accommodate you on your arrival.</p>
    <p> Group bookings of 20 or more on a set menu can be offered a choice of arrival times, please email us for more
      information.</p>

    <h3 class="title-2">DINNER</h3>
    <p>Reservations indoors for the Smoko Room can be made for dinner from 5.30pm onwards for any number of guests. To
      make a reservation email smokoroom@sawmillbrewery.co.nz or call 09 422 6555 (ext. 1). </p>
    <p>We don't take reservations for our outdoor area so please come early to secure a table if you'd like to dine
      outside.</p>


    <h3 class="title-3">GROUP BOOKINGS</h3>
    <p>Reservations of 20 or more adults are required to order from one of our 'trust us' set menus. Please get in touch
      with us to find out more and to reserve a table: <a class="link-2"
        href="mailto:smokoroom@sawmillbrewery.co.nz">smokoroom@sawmillbrewery.co.nz</a>. </p>
    <p>Reservations for groups of 20 or more adults can be made any time throughout the day.</p>



    <h3 class="title-4">WEDDINGS</h3>
    <p>Getting married in the Matakana area? If you’re after a pre-wedding meal with your guests, we can accommodate 20
      – 60 people depending on the day of the week, and season.
      If you’re looking to hold your wedding reception at the Sawmill, we’re also open to talk about this! Again, this
      is dependent on day of the week, and season, and includes a hireage fee and set menu. </p>
    <h3></h3>
    <p></p>Please note that we aren’t wedding planners, so can’t take care of all the details on your special day –
    we’re here to make sure you have an amazing dining experience and great drinks. Any decorations or flowers are up to
    you, and if set-up is more than a couple basic bits, you’ll also need to organize staff for this, as we don’t have
    enough of our own. As we are a B-Corp certified business, we also request that decorations do not contain any small
    plastic bits (confetti, balloons etc), as these can get into the waterways near our site and have negative
    environmental impact.

    Please reach out via email and we’ll be in touch! <a class="link-1"
